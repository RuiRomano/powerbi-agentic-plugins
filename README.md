# Power BI Agentic Plugins

Plugins that turn GitHub Copilot into a specialist for Power BI and Microsoft Fabric development. Built for [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli) and [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), also compatible with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Why Plugins

GitHub Copilot helps you write code. Plugins let you go further: teach Copilot how Power BI semantic models should be structured, which Fabric CLI commands to use, how to author reports in PBIR format, and what best practices to follow — so you get accurate, domain-specific help instead of generic suggestions.

Each plugin bundles the skills, tools, and agents for a specific area of the Microsoft data platform. Out of the box, they give Copilot a strong starting point for Power BI and Fabric work. The real power comes when you customize them for your organization — your naming conventions, your workspace structure, your modeling patterns.

## Plugins

| Plugin                           | What it does                                                                                                                      | 
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| **[powerbi](./plugins/powerbi)** | Create semantic models, author reports in PBIR, write DAX queries, explore published datasets, and apply modeling best practices. | 
| **[fabric](./plugins/fabric)**   | Navigate workspaces, import/export item definitions, call Fabric & Power BI REST APIs, run jobs, and manage OneLake files.        | 

Every plugin follows the same structure:

```
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Manifest
├── .mcp.json                    # Tool connections
├── agents/                      # Agent personas with role-specific instructions
└── skills/                      # Domain knowledge Copilot draws on automatically
```

- **Skills** encode domain expertise, best practices, command references, and step-by-step workflows. Copilot draws on them automatically when relevant.
- **Agents** define personas with specific responsibilities (e.g., a Power BI creator vs. consumer) and declare which skills and tools to use.
- **Connectors** wire Copilot to external tools — the Fabric CLI and Power BI Modeling MCP — via [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

**These plugins are starting points.** They become much more useful when you customize them for how your team actually works:

- **Add company context** — Add your naming conventions, workspace structure, and modeling patterns into skill files so Copilot understands your world.
- **Adjust workflows** — Modify skill instructions to match how your team does things (e.g., your deployment pipeline, your BPA rules).
- **Swap connectors** — Edit `.mcp.json` to point at your specific MCP servers.
- **Build new plugins** — Follow the structure above to create plugins for additional scenarios.
  
## Getting Started

Make sure you complete the prerequisites, set up your preferred AI assistant, and try one of the [scenarios](#scenarios).

### Pre-requisites

- Install [Fabric CLI](https://microsoft.github.io/fabric-cli/)

### Copilot CLI

- Install [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli)
- Open Copilot and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    # Open GitHub Copilot CLI
    copilot

    # Add the marketplace (one-time setup)
    /plugin marketplace add RuiRomano/powerbi-agentic-plugins

    # Install plugins
    /plugin install powerbi@powerbi-agentic-plugins
    /plugin install fabric@powerbi-agentic-plugins

    # Restart Copilot to activate
    ```

Once installed, plugins activate automatically. Skills fire when relevant — for example, asking Copilot to create a semantic model automatically pulls in the `powerbi-semantic-model` skill.

### VS Code

- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install [GitHub Copilot Chat extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
- Clone this repo and configure [VS Code skills](vscode://settings/chat.agentSkillsLocations) to point at the skill folders:

### Scenarios

#### New Direct Lake semantic model on top of Lakehouse tables

```
# 1. Create a Lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric
# 2. Load it with some sample data, e.g. Retail sample data
# 3. Prompt:
> Create a new direct lake semantic model in workspace [workspace] that uses the tables from lakehouse [lakehouse]
```

#### Semantic Model on top of CSV data

```
# Prompt:
> Use the powerbi-semantic-model skill to create a new semantic model based on the CSV files
> located in \assets\sample-data. Apply standard modeling best practices throughout.
> Using PBIR also create a sample report on top of the semantic model.
```
